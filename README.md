# TA&AM mutual learning project
Here we are going to do excercises for Python online courses and keep the results. Also we will train our Git skills.

## Development
Git commits must have __[FTC]__ prefix

## App structure
The main app is just a dispatcher running one of the training task. The task you are working on (default task) is definded in AMTA.cfg file in the "Current_lesson" variable. 
Each task is a function defined in a separate file situates in the Lessons directory. If the task assumed to have more then one file we put it into the dedicated subdirectory.
